// Write a method `factorial(n)` which takes a number and returns the factorial of n.
// A factorial is the product of all whole numbers between 1 and n, inclusive.
// For example, `factorial(5)` is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

function factorial(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;

    return n * factorial(n - 1)
}

// Write a method fib(n) that takes in a number and returns the nth number of
// the fibonacci sequence.
//
// In the fibonacci sequence, the 1st number is 1 and the 2nd number is 1. To generate the
// next number in the sequence, we take the sum of the previous two fibonacci numbers.
// For example the first 5 numbers of the fibonacci sequence are `1, 1, 2, 3, 5`
