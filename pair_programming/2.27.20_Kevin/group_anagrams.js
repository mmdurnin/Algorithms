/*
Write a function that takes in an array of strings and returns a list
of groups of anagrams. Anagrams are strings made up of exactly the same letters,
where order doesn't matter. For example, "cinema" and "iceman" are anagrams.
Note thatt tthe groups of anagrams don't need to be ordered in any particular way.

ex: 
input: ["yo", "act", "flop", "tac", "cat", "oy", "olfp"]
output: [["yo", "oy"], ["flop", "olfp"], ["act", "tac", "cat"]]
