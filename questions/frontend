• What is Big O notation, and why is it useful?
Big O notation is used to describe the complexity of an algorithm, and how expensive it will be for the machine to run the algorithm in the worst case scenario.
O(1) - Constant: independent of input size
O(log(n)) - Logarithmic: running time grows in proportion to the logarithm of the input size (at first relatively expensive and goes down)
O(n) - Linear: directly proportional to input size 
O(n * log(n)) - Quasilinear / Loglinear: Executes n number of operations, each of which runs in logarithmic time
O(n^2) - Quadratic: Executes n number of operations, each of which requires n number of operations
O(n^c) - Polynomial: C = fixed constant, executes n number of operations, each of which requires n number of operations a constant number of times
O(c^n) - Exponential: Algorithms growth multiplies by the constant with each additional unit of input size 
       (e.g., O(2^n) doubles with each addition to the input data set)
       ex: generate all subsets/ combinations in an array
O(n!) - Factorial: Think: a recursive call that has n # of recursive calls in each stack
       n! = (n) * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ....
       ex: Permutations (all possible combinations AND orders)

• What is the DOM?
Document Object Model
Programming interface to web pages
**Represents the page as objects and nodes
Programs can connect to the DOM to read, write and manipulate content
Opening devtools gives you a visual representation/ map of the DOM
Gets created from HTML document

• What is the event loop?
While javascript in single threaded, it operates asynchronously with its use of asynchronous functionsthe event loop.
Javascript uses a callstack to keep track of order in which to execute functions. 
In this way, it does not necessarily read top to bottom. 
Some functions will be added to the stack with event listeners, some as callbacks, there are also functions that will trigger a web api request (i.e., setTimeOut). This predicts the order in which things are added to the stack.
When setTimeOut is executed, the function is taken out of the stack and is handled by a web API which in this case will track the amount of time.
When the specified amount of time has been reached, the setTimeOut callback will be sent to another component of the operation called the callback queue.
My understanding is that the actual event loop is a very small part of this: it will look at the stack and look at the queue. If there isn't anything in the stack, it will pull the first thing out of the queue and add it to the stack to be executed.
But I think we generally think of the whole process as the event loop.


• What is a closure?
A closure is a function that can be stored as a variable that has the special ability of being able to access the scope of another function.
Specifically, it has access to the scope (the "lexical environment") in which it was defined. 
Another definition that I like: A closure is a function plus a connection to the variables that exist at its “birth place”
Its called a closure because it is an operation where one function closes over the other.
* A nested function's scope includes variables declared within the function where it was defined
When the function has finished executing, that scope is usually destroyed/ irrelevant (unaccessable)but when you create an inner function, 
the variables from the outer function are not destroyed after execution because the inner function still has access to it
Uses: 
1. Private state - in ruby you can write functions under a private property but you cannot do this with JavaScript.
In JavaScript, we can emulate the private keyword by using closures.
Variables defined inside of a function can only be accessed in the scope of that function. 
2. Readers and writers - Change the values of local variables by functions defined inside of it.
function accessLocal() {
    var local = 10
}
-- see how you can never change local?
function accessLocal() {
    var local = 10
    return {
        seeLocal: function() {
            return local
        }
        changeLocal: function(increment) {
            local += increment
            return local
        }
    }
}
maintainLocal = accessLocal()
maintainLocal.seeLocal() --> 10
maintainLocal.changeLocal(10) --> 20
** 3. They can also be used by functions to store state that persists across function calls. 

Think of it like this: when a function is invoked with an argument, the function will run, return a value, and the state will not change
A closure will hold onto the state of the outer function at the time in which it was invoked

(this is also a bad question IMO, but a lot of people like to ask it too)

• Explain The Difference Between Static, Fixed, Absolute And Relative Positioning?
STATIC: default, *no z-index*, no nudging, takes up normal space, informally considered "not positioned"
- overflow: hidden only works on other static elements, so if its not working, change it to positin relative
RELATIVE: initially displayed in same space as it would static but it can be nudged "relative" to its original (static) position
- creates a coordinate system for its absolute children
- allows z-index
- switch from static to relative with no consequences
- Most often used when you want to position children absolute
ABSOLUTE: without setting left /right whatever, it will be positioned where it would have been positioned within document flow
- lifted out of space on the page
- offset coordinates are positiond relative to nearest ancestor that is not position static
- margins do not collapse
- left/ right/ top/ bottom properties will stretch it
- the box of the element will take up minimal space unless overwritten by width/ height
FIXED: offset coordinates are relative to the window, *not the document* - since not all windows are the same size, this could result in the element being positioned weird
- stays in place relative to the window, even on scroll
- like absolute: allows z-index, the box takes minimal size unless specified by height and width, margins can be set but do not collapse, left/ right etc can stretch element
- does not take space on page, lifted up
- also creates coordinate system for absolute children

• What is react?
React is a JavaScript User Interface library 
Used for simplifying by building User Interface components
Uses a virtual DOM which increases efficiency to state changes by only rerendering effected elements on the page
--> it does this by using a diffing algorithm between the virtual dom and the real dom
    Whenever anything may have changed, the entire UI will be re-rendered in a Virtual DOM representation.
    The difference between the previous Virtual DOM representation and the new one will be calculated.
    The real DOM will be updated with what has actually changed. This is very much like applying a patch.

• Pros of react
    - creates a virtual DOM which speeds up rerendering by only updating the real dom with needed changes
    - Uses one way data binding: ReactJS allows for direct work with components and uses downward data binding to ensure that changes 
      of child structures don’t affect their parents. That makes code stable.

• What are promises, what are their 3 states?

• What are psuedo elements? What are psuedoclasses? Psuedo content?
PSUEDO CONTENT: Used to inject content INSIDE of an element either at the beginning or the end
- default styling inline
- ex: 
h1:before {
    content: ___
}
(so you need to specify "content:" to inject content into it)
- you can inject string content or attribute content
- adding attribute content ex: 
a:after {
  content: " (" attr(href) ")";
}

• What is "use strict"?
Adding "use strict" do the document creates a mode that watches for/prohibits variable declaration without const, var etc. 
Without "use strict", you could say x = "elephant" without erroring out. This could create a problem if you assign a variable 
inside of a function that is meant to only be scoped to that function (without declaring, it will be globally scoped). 
"Use strict" mode will return an error when assigning a variable without declaring it with const/ var/ etc.

• What is webpack?

• What are the two main types of values in JavaScript?
1) Primitives
2) Objects 

• What are the primitives in JavaScript and what are the types?
Primitives are Javascript values that are not objects and are immutable, meaning that they themselves cannot be altered.
Think: you can assign a string to x, but you cannot alter the string. You actually have to reassign
x.toUpperCase() will not mutate the string assigned to x. You have to say x=x.toUpperCase(). Same with x.push("more letters"). That doesnt work
There are 5-7 primitives, depending on who you're asking. Here are the 7:
- null
- undefined
- string
- number
- bigint
- boolean
- symbol
Besides null and undefined, all values have object equivalents that wrap around the primitive values.
