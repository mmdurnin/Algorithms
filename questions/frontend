• What is Big O notation, and why is it useful?
Big O notation is used to describe the complexity of an algorithm, and how expensive it will be for the machine to run the algorithm in the worst case scenario.
O(1) - Constant: independent of input size
O(log(n)) - Logarithmic: running time grows in proportion to the logarithm of the input size (at first relatively expensive and goes down)
O(n) - Linear: directly proportional to input size 
O(n * log(n)) - Quasilinear / Loglinear: Executes n number of operations, each of which runs in logarithmic time
O(n^2) - Quadratic: Executes n number of operations, each of which requires n number of operations
O(n^c) - Polynomial: C = fixed constant, executes n number of operations, each of which requires n number of operations a constant number of times
O(c^n) - Exponential: Algorithms growth multiplies by the constant with each additional unit of input size 
       (e.g., O(2^n) doubles with each addition to the input data set)
       ex: generate all subsets/ combinations in an array
O(n!) - Factorial: Think: a recursive call that has n # of recursive calls in each stack
       n! = (n) * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ....
       ex: Permutations (all possible combinations AND orders)

• What is the DOM?
Document Object Model
Programming interface to web pages
**Represents the page as objects and nodes
Programs can connect to the DOM to read, write and manipulate content
Opening devtools gives you a visual representation/ map of the DOM
Gets created from HTML document

• What is the event loop?
While javascript in single threaded, it operates asynchronously with its use of asynchronous functionsthe event loop.
Javascript uses a callstack to keep track of order in which to execute functions. 
In this way, it does not necessarily read top to bottom. 
Some functions will be added to the stack with event listeners, some as callbacks, there are also functions that will trigger a web api request (i.e., setTimeOut). This predicts the order in which things are added to the stack.
When setTimeOut is executed, the function is taken out of the stack and is handled by a web API which in this case will track the amount of time.
When the specified amount of time has been reached, the setTimeOut callback will be sent to another component of the operation called the callback queue.
My understanding is that the actual event loop is a very small part of this: it will look at the stack and look at the queue. If there isn't anything in the stack, it will pull the first thing out of the queue and add it to the stack to be executed.
But I think we generally think of the whole process as the event loop.


• What is a closure?
A closure is a function that can be stored as a variable that has the special ability of being able to access the scope of another function.
Specifically, it has access to the scope (the "lexical environment") in which it was defined. 
Another definition that I like: A closure is a function plus a connection to the variables that exist at its “birth place”
Its called a closure because it is an operation where one function closes over the other.
* A nested function's scope includes variables declared within the function where it was defined
When the function has finished executing, that scope is usually destroyed/ irrelevant (unaccessable)but when you create an inner function, 
the variables from the outer function are not destroyed after execution because the inner function still has access to it
Uses: 
1. Private state - in ruby you can write functions under a private property but you cannot do this with JavaScript.
In JavaScript, we can emulate the private keyword by using closures.
Variables defined inside of a function can only be accessed in the scope of that function. 
2. Readers and writers - Change the values of local variables by functions defined inside of it.
function accessLocal() {
    var local = 10
}
-- see how you can never change local?
function accessLocal() {
    var local = 10
    return {
        seeLocal: function() {
            return local
        }
        changeLocal: function(increment) {
            local += increment
            return local
        }
    }
}
maintainLocal = accessLocal()
maintainLocal.seeLocal() --> 10
maintainLocal.changeLocal(10) --> 20
** 3. They can also be used by functions to store state that persists across function calls. 

Think of it like this: when a function is invoked with an argument, the function will run, return a value, and the state will not change
A closure will hold onto the state of the outer function at the time in which it was invoked




• How is prototypal inheritance different from classical inheritance? 
- classical inheritance describes a system that is more taxonomy-based: a more specific class will inherit from a more general class
  with prototypal inheritance, the inheriting object is more like an example of the ancestor object
- classical inheritance is like passing on a blue print: descriptions of format and instantiation get passed down
  prototypal inheritance is like delegation and it involves a prototype chain (explained below), but in brief:
        each ancestor in the chain will check if they have the method or attribute being searched for and then they'll ask their ancestors
- classical inheritance separates classes with instances and happens through instantiation (you have the class that describes and the instances)
  prototypal inheritance is more like linking on object to the other (one object points to another)


• How does prototypal inheritance work?
First, some vocab:
PROTOTYPE: the object that holds methods for the inheritors, held by the ancestor
(ex: Array.prototype.reverse --> The Array prototype holds a function called reverse that all instances of the Array can have access to)
__PROTO__: internal object that holds info about the instance and pointers to its ancestors prototype (points to prototype it was created from)
prototype = property of class constructor (this is what my children will inherit) and proto = property of instance (this is what I have inherited)
1. When a method gets called on an object, the search starts with direct methods on the object 
2. It then looks on the __proto__ of the object, which points to the prototype of the object it inherited from
3. Prototypes also have a proto which points to greater ancestor's prototype
So if I said "sparky.__proto__.__proto__" that would point to he prototype of animal
DIY inheritance function:
Function.prototype.inherits = function(Parent) {
  function Surrogate() {}
  Surrogate.prototype = Parent.prototype;
  this.prototype = new Surrogate();
  this.prototype.constructor = this;
};


• What is a higher order function? 
A function that takes a function as an argument and/or returns a function.

• What type of language is Javascript? (object oriented vs functional)
JavaScript is both object oriented and functional

• Functional vs OOP:
                            FUNCTIONAL                                                  OOP

• What is event bubbling and how does it work? 
(this is also a bad question IMO, but a lot of people like to ask it too)
An event will bubble up an element's ancestors. If there is an event listener on an ancestor, an action will fire.

• What is REST, and why do people use it?
REST stands for representational state transfer
It is a set of principals related to client/server HTTP requests
APIs that adhere to RESTful architecture are making use of specific verbs, resources and format that can be easily understood by the server
The client can say get me information, change this information, delete this information 

• My website is slow. Walk me through diagnosing and fixing it. 
What are some performance optimizations people use, and when should they be used?
- Event delegation can be used when you have the same action that needs to be registered to a bunch of child elements
  (reduce load time by sticking the event listener on the parent element - the events bubble)
- Minimizing calls to the backend 
  - Use a sprite (= make a collage of images rather than separate requests and zip them up for their delivery, unzip them on the front end)
  - set up browser caching (= set e-tags on the request headers for the cached info, the server will compare the date last sent to the date last updated)
- Lazy loading
- Be strategic on where you're loading your javascript files (or launch them only after an event listener is triggered saynig that the page is fully loaded)
- Use a CDN

• What frameworks have you used? What are the pros and cons of each? 
RAILS:
PROS:
- it's relatively easy to learn and based on its popularity there is a lot of information out there for debugging
- Because it's so widely used, it's also very reliable
- it accepts a lot of useful libraries (or "gems")
- it requires a strong adherence to convention
  -- easier to understand other people's code, more readable, easier to collaborate
  -- minimizes the amount of code you need to write in the future
CONS:
- strong coding standards / strictness is a tradeoff for flexibility
- its a heavy framework
REACT
Technically react is only a library because it only gives you means to build components and render them in the DOM 
But I've talked to a lot of people who casually refer to it as a framework because its a much larger ecosystem with its own specialized language, tools etc
So I wanted to bring up that I have used it 
PROS:
- It's so organized!
- React creates a virtual DOM which speeds up rerendering time 
CONS:
- Not extremely necessary for smaller projects
  - requires a lot of set up
  - theres a lot of extra code involved in formatting components which minimizes for bigger projects but could be wasteful for smaller

• Why do people use frameworks? What kinds of problems do frameworks solve?
- Frameworks make learning easier. Learning is much more achievable within some type of structure where you can make connections and operate by rules and frameworks make this possible.
- Frameworks make collaboration easier because its easier to understand another person's code when they're writing within a framework
- Easier to debug 
  -they have more rules, meaning that the behavior of your code is going to be more predictable
  -more public info, resources, documentation for debugging
- Usually also a lot of libraries that will help you reach your objective

• Explain What Is The Lazy Loading?
Lazy loading is an optimization technique where on page load, you only load the required resources and elements on to the page
and then others are loaded as needed

• What is the difference between null and undefined?
Both represent empty values but null is a type object and by convention, when you want to assign nothing, you set null
whereas undefined is returned when nothing was assigned, however you can set undefined (in practice you set null)

• What is scope?
The scope of a method is the set of variables available inside of the method, including:
- variables defined inside of the method
- variables declared before function was defined
- arguments

• What Is Variable Scope?
- JavaScript variables are functionally scoped.

• Explain The Difference Between Static, Fixed, Absolute And Relative Positioning?
STATIC: default, *no z-index*, no nudging, takes up normal space, informally considered "not positioned"
- overflow: hidden only works on other static elements, so if its not working, change it to positin relative
RELATIVE: initially displayed in same space as it would static but it can be nudged "relative" to its original (static) position
- creates a coordinate system for its absolute children
- allows z-index
- switch from static to relative with no consequences
- Most often used when you want to position children absolute
ABSOLUTE: without setting left /right whatever, it will be positioned where it would have been positioned within document flow
- lifted out of space on the page
- offset coordinates are positiond relative to nearest ancestor that is not position static
- margins do not collapse
- left/ right/ top/ bottom properties will stretch it
- the box of the element will take up minimal space unless overwritten by width/ height
FIXED: offset coordinates are relative to the window, *not the document* - since not all windows are the same size, this could result in the element being positioned weird
- stays in place relative to the window, even on scroll
- like absolute: allows z-index, the box takes minimal size unless specified by height and width, margins can be set but do not collapse, left/ right etc can stretch element
- does not take space on page, lifted up
- also creates coordinate system for absolute children

• What is react?
React is a JavaScript User Interface library 
Used for simplifying by building User Interface components
Uses a virtual DOM which increases efficiency to state changes by only rerendering effected elements on the page
--> it does this by using a diffing algorithm between the virtual dom and the real dom
    Whenever anything may have changed, the entire UI will be re-rendered in a Virtual DOM representation.
    The difference between the previous Virtual DOM representation and the new one will be calculated.
    The real DOM will be updated with what has actually changed. This is very much like applying a patch.

• Pros of react
    - creates a virtual DOM which speeds up rerendering by only updating the real dom with needed changes
    - Uses one way data binding: ReactJS allows for direct work with components and uses downward data binding to ensure that changes 
      of child structures don’t affect their parents. That makes code stable.

• React lifecycle methods: what are they? How purpose to they serve? List and talk about.

• What are promises, what are their 3 states? 
- A promise is an object that represents completion or failure of an asynchronous operation

• CSS - nth element / first child

• What is shadow DOM?

• What are psuedo elements? What are psuedoclasses? Psuedo content?
PSUEDO CONTENT: Used to inject content INSIDE of an element either at the beginning or the end
- default styling inline
- ex: 
h1:before {
    content: ___
}
(so you need to specify "content:" to inject content into it)
- you can inject string content or attribute content
- adding attribute content ex: 
a:after {
  content: " (" attr(href) ")";
}

• What is a framework?

• What is "use strict"?
Adding "use strict" do the document creates a mode that watches for/prohibits variable declaration without const, var etc. 
Without "use strict", you could say x = "elephant" without erroring out. This could create a problem if you assign a variable 
inside of a function that is meant to only be scoped to that function (without declaring, it will be globally scoped). 
"Use strict" mode will return an error when assigning a variable without declaring it with const/ var/ etc.

• What is webpack?

• What are the two main types of values in JavaScript?
1) Primitives
2) Objects 

• What are the primitives in JavaScript and what are the types?
Primitives are Javascript values that are not objects and are immutable, meaning that they themselves cannot be altered.
Think: you can assign a string to x, but you cannot alter the string. You actually have to reassign
x.toUpperCase() will not mutate the string assigned to x. You have to say x=x.toUpperCase(). Same with x.push("more letters"). That doesnt work
There are 5-7 primitives, depending on who you're asking. Here are the 7:
- null
- undefined
- string
- number
- bigint
- boolean
- symbol
Besides null and undefined, all values have object equivalents that wrap around the primitive values.
