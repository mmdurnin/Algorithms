• What is the event loop?
While javascript in single threaded, it operates asynchronously with its use of the event loop.
Javascript uses a callstack to keep track of order in which to execute functions. 
In this way, it does not necessarily read top to bottom. 
Some functions will be added to the stack with event listeners, some as callbacks, there are also functions that will trigger a web api request (i.e., setTimeOut). This predicts the order in which things are added to the stack.
When setTimeOut is executed, the function is taken out of the stack and is handled by a web API which in this case will track the amount of time.
When the specified amount of time has been reached, the setTimeOut callback will be sent to another component of the operation called the callback queue.
My understanding is that the actual event loop is a very small part of this: it will look at the stack and look at the queue. If there isn't anything in the stack, it will pull the first thing out of the queue and add it to the stack to be executed.
But I think we generally think of the whole process as the event loop.
