• When is recursion appropriate?
    - Recursion is used to solve problems that can be decomposed into smaller versions of the same problem.

• Tell Us The Purpose Of Each Of The Http Request Types When Used With A Restful Web Service?
GET: Client tells server to provide some type of specified content
PATCH: Client tells server to make a change
PUT: Also saying make a change but less used because I think it replaces all of the info rather than changing the existing info
POST: Client tells server to accept/ create new content (like creating a new user account)
DELETE: Client tells server to destroy specified content

• What happens when you type in www.google.com?
- Every DNS (Domain Name Server) corresponds to and IP address
1. Browser will check its own DNS cache, then the operating system's cache, then the router's cache, then the internet service provider (ISP)'s
   DNS cache in search of the the corresponding IP address
2. The browser builds the the HTTP request (in this example, a GET request)
3. The browser sends the request over the network
  (*border gateway protocol*)
4. (Possible interaction with proxy server / load balancer / CDN / etc.)
  - CDN: Content Delivery Network, a network of servers in place to deliver content over the shortest distance so that it 
    can be more quickly delivered anywhere on the globe
5. Server parses request string and routes it using Regex on the request path
6. The application layer assembles its response. There could be a possible connection to the database server
7. The response is sent back over the network with a status code 
8. The client parses the response
  - checks the headers (in particular the status code which will indicate the status of the response)
9. Browser goes through the HTML and paints the DOM
10. The browser might build a new GET request for each of the CSS / JS tags (objects embeded in the HTML), go through the same steps & run code before proceeding

• What is a CORS request? (what does CORS stand for?)
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, 
access to selected resources from a different origin.

• What are the HTTP status codes?
1xx - informational
2xx - success
3xx - redirection
4xx - client error
5xx - server error

• What do you like about Ruby?
- readable & verbose
  -- really easy to learn
  -- really easy to understand other people's code when you're working on a collaboration
- object oriented
- basically it's an easy language

• What do you like about Rails?
- "convention over configuration"

• Pros and cons of rails:
PROS:
- it's relatively easy to learn and based on its popularity there is a lot of information out there for debugging
- Because it's so widely used, it's also very reliable
- it accepts a lot of useful libraries (or "gems")
- it requires a strong adherence to convention
  -- easier to understand other people's code, more readable, easier to collaborate
  -- minimizes the amount of code you need to write in the future
CONS:
- strong coding standards / strictness is a tradeoff for flexibility
- its a heavy framework


• My website is slow. Walk me through diagnosing and fixing it. 
- Minimize database queries by grabbing all the required info at once and parsing it
- Event delegation can be used when you have the same action that needs to be registered to a bunch of child elements
  (reduce load time by sticking the event listener on the parent element - the events bubble)
- Minimizing calls to the backend 
  - Use a sprite (= make a collage of images rather than separate requests and zip them up for their delivery, unzip them on the front end)
  - set up browser caching (= set e-tags on the request headers for the cached info, the server will compare the date last sent to the date last updated)
- Lazy loading
- Be strategic on where you're loading your javascript files (or launch them only after an event listener is triggered saynig that the page is fully loaded)
- Use a CDN
