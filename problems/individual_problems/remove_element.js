/*
Given an array "nums" and a value, remove all instances of that value *in place* and return the new length.

* Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input
array in-place with O(1) extra memory

ex: nums=[3, 2, 2, 3] val = 3
    solution: 2 (resulting array is array of length 2, all 3s removed)
